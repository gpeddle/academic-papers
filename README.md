*Testing The Quantum Of Cats A In Population Aerodynamic*


Generate a graph of fake, but reasonable-looking academic papers.

Each paper shall have a title, authors, and references.

The resulting graph can then be used for further research into how academic papers relate and how to detect importance.
Essentially, the initial graph is noisy, and we want to create methods that can identify items that are unimportant.
